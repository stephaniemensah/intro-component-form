# Intro Component Form

Built this from frontend mentor coding challenge. 

The Intro Component Form is a responsive web form that allows users to view the optimal layout for the site based on their device's screen size. It provides a visually appealing interface with interactive elements and validation for form submission. Users can experience hover states for interactive elements and receive error messages when the form is submitted with invalid or empty input fields.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form layout adjusts dynamically to provide an optimal viewing experience on different screen sizes and devices. Whether accessed from a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, users will enjoy a visually appealing and user-friendly layout.

- **Hover States**: Interactive elements within the form exhibit hover states, providing visual feedback to users when they interact with buttons, input fields, or other interactive elements. This enhances the overall user experience and improves usability.

- **Form Validation**: When the user submits the form, the system performs validation checks on the input fields. The following error messages are displayed if necessary:

  - Empty Fields: If any required input field is left empty, an error message is displayed for that specific field, indicating that it cannot be empty. For example, if the name field is empty, the error message will be displayed as "Name cannot be empty".

  - Invalid Email Address: If the entered email address is not in the correct format, an error message is displayed, stating that the email address is not valid. The message will be displayed as "Looks like this is not an email".

## How to Use

1. **View Optimal Layout**: Open the Intro Component Form in a web browser on your device. The form layout will adapt to the screen size, providing the best viewing experience.

2. **Hover States**: Move your cursor over the interactive elements, such as buttons or input fields, to experience the hover states. These states indicate that the element is clickable or selectable.

3. **Submit the Form**: Fill in the required information in the input fields, such as name and email address. Click the submit button to validate and submit the form.

4. **Form Validation**: If any required field is empty, an error message will appear below the respective field, indicating that it cannot be empty. If the email address is not in the correct format, an error message will be displayed below the email field, stating that it is not a valid email address.
